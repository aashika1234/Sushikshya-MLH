# Sushikshya-MLH
Sushikshya is a platform which provides books based on Augumented Reality. Why to buy and study books with plain text and 2D images only when Sushikshya is offering AR-Book with 3-D models and animations implemented..

#How to set up project:
1: You should have Unity installed with android support, Java JDK, NDK installed and set up properly for mobile app production.
2: Once setting up the floor go to vuforia.com and download the vuforia sdk and add it in the project.
3: After that print the book page 1 and page 2 (only colour print).
4: After that run the project, and project the image in front of camera. Alternatively you can use the apk file we provided and test the application.
5: Please note that because of limitation of time frame we have not optimized the app to ework on evey cases so pleas test the app in natural light at daytime.

Thank You:
